Objective:

Calculator app that performs basic arithmetic 

Features:

* Decimal placement 
* Comma placement for every thousand
* Digit max limit to 12 digits to prevent printed numbers from outsourcing the output area of the calculator
* In the middle of an arithmetic problem, the user can clear the screen, and click on a new second number to continue the problem without deleting the first clicked number. 

For Example: 

The user can click 1 + 4 but they can click AC to clear out 4. Then they can click a new number such as 9 to get 10. This saves time for the user from having to start the arithmetic problem back to 1 + 9
